# PoshMPlayer
A module for controlling your mediaplayer (mainly spotify, but others might work as well) without leaving your console. 
misses a lot of functionality, but it´s a work in progress.

Todo list:
	
	~~Add OAuth authentication to search spotify. ~~
	~~Needed to see personal settings, what is included in a playlist etc.~~
	
	**Thank you Johan Nilsson**

	Better way of starting a playlist or artist. 
	Uses virtual keystrokes and active window handles right now. it works, but it´s ugly.

	Better way of setting volume.
	Use 'vkey volup/voldown' to step 2% each time. would like to set to specific % directly.
